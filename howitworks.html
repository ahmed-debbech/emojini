        <h1>How Emojini Works?</h1>
        <p>
            1 - set a starting sequence of caracters as you like <br>
            2 - set the list of emojis by pasting them in 'Emoji' field in the table <br>
            3 - in the second column write the shortcut (seqence of caracters eg : 'lv' for loving-face emoji) <br> 
            of the corresponded emoji *again as you like.<br>
            4 - click Apply to save <br>
            Now you can write a text in any field of any website and when you want to write an emoji <br>
            just type [your_starting_caracter]+[caracter_of_the_emoji] and it will be replaced automatically. <br>
            <b>Example</b> <br>
            starting caracter: _& <br>
            loving-face caracter: lv <br>
            when you combine them: _&lv --> you get: üòç
