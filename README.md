# Emojini! 
A Chrome extension to write emojis faster with key bindings.

### How it Works
1 - set a starting sequence of caracters as you like \
2 - set the list of emojis by pasting them in 'Emoji' field in the table \
3 - in the second column write the shortcut (seqence of caracters eg : 'lv' for loving-face emoji) \
of the corresponded emoji *again as you like. \
4 - click Apply to save \
Now you can write a text in any field of any website and when you want to write an emoji \
just type [your_starting_caracter]+[caracter_of_the_emoji] and it will be replaced automatically. \
**Example** \
starting caracter: _& \
loving-face caracter: lv \
when you combine them: _&lv --> you get: 😍
